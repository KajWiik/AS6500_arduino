## 🔍 Overview

The AS6500 is a high-precision Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) capable of measuring time intervals with picosecond resolution. This Arduino library provides a complete interface to the AS6500, handling all low-level SPI communication, calibration, and configuration, allowing you to focus on your time measurement application.

**Key Specifications:**
- Time resolution: Picosecond precision
- Interface: SPI (up to 10 MHz)
- Supply voltage: 3.3V
- Operating modes: Single-shot and continuous
- Built-in calibration: Automatic temperature compensation

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Full SPI Communication** - Complete SPI protocol implementation with configurable clock speeds up to 10 MHz
- ✅ **Multiple Measurement Modes** - Single-shot and continuous measurement modes
- ✅ **Automatic Calibration** - Built-in calibration routines with verification and timeout handling
- ✅ **Flexible Configuration** - Configurable timeout values (0-15) and signal averaging (1, 2, 4, or 8 cycles)
- ✅ **Interrupt Management** - Complete interrupt status monitoring and control
- ✅ **High Precision** - Access to both picosecond and nanosecond time resolution
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive timeout and error detection with status reporting
- ✅ **Easy-to-Use API** - High-level convenience functions for common operations
- ✅ **Low-Level Access** - Direct register read/write access for advanced users
